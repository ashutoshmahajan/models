## Models for Mixed-Integer Nonlinear Optimization

A few optimization models for testing solvers like
[Minotaur](https://minotaur-solver.github.io/). A few more models from various
classroom exercises or research projects are also included. Models in python
require [Pyomo](https://pyomo.org).

To run any model, first edit py/run.py. Then do:

    python run.py
